1) When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When I will be working either from different computers, or with other people or both.

2) Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Automatically updating with the remote repository would have the risk
that changes made by another perosn working on the same file could be
transfered to my computer, without me having checked them first.
